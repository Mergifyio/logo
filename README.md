# Mergify Logo

This repository contains source files for Mergify logo.

## Usage

You can build some PNG version from the master SVG. Simply type `make`.

The brand mark of Mergify can be used separately. As a digital-first company
where brand recognition is important in various situations where space is
limited, this brand mark can be used. We distinguish a primary version for
regular use: such as the Mergiy logo within navigation of the platform, or for
usage on social media profile images and more subtle marks in imagery or social
media covers. The secondary version is used for very small sizes (such as a
browser favicon at 40px or smaller).
