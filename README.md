The brand mark of Mergify can be used separately. As a digital-first company
where brand recognition is important in various situations where space is
limited, this brand mark can be used. We distinguish a primary version for
regular use: such as the mergiy logo within navigation of the platform, or for
usage on social media profile images and more subtle marks in imagery or social
media covers.

### mergify-brandmark-{white,black}-secondary

The secondary version is used for very small sizes (such as a browser favicon
at 40px or smaller).

### mergify-brandmark-multi-bg{,-secondary}

This version of the brand mark makes it possible to be used for both light and
dark background. This is especially useful if you don't control the background
that will be used to display the brand mark.
